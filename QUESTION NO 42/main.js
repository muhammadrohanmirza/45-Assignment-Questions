// Q42)Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase 
// the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
//Answer:
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + " the Great";
    }
}
make_great(magicians); // Modifies the original array
show_magicians(magicians); // Shows modified names
